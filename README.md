# ![Thought-Swap](client/assets/project-logo.png)

A web app that aims to widen and deepen the scope of participation in 
facilitated discussions by minimizing participant self-consciousness,
social intimidation, and time pressure.

## Project in Action
ThoughtSwap is actively being tested and used at [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu)
in classroom discussions by over 200 students. You can view the project's home 
at [thoughtswap.cs.vt.edu](http://thoughtswap.cs.vt.edu/)

For discussion facilitators, ThoughtSwap provides a platform for the creation of
groups, group sessions with prompts, and a platform to moderate and discuss 
responses. For participants it provides a platform for viewing the prompt, and
sharing their thoughts. A system of "silly name" generation for usernames and
random thought distribution helps to anonymize them from their peers.

A glimpse of this can be seen below:
