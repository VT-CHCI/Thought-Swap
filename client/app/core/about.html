    <h1>What is ThoughtSwap?</h1>
    <p>
      ThoughtSwap is a technology that is intended to be used to change the distribution of power and authority in the classroom by changing access to information about what other people are thinking.  The point of ThoughtSwap is to provoke better face-to-face conversations.  Good conversation are not inevitable, so using ThoughtSwap to good effect requires careful thought and adaptation by the facilitator or professor to the particulars of their classroom. <br> <br> 

      ThoughtSwap is the product of ThirdLab at Virginia Tech, a laboratory in the department of Computer Science that has several goals featuring the design of simple technologies to that either change power and authority or that change user perspectives on power and authority.  
      Alan Kay famously said that a change in perspective is worth 50 I.Q. points.  Our technologies change perspectives in small but surprisingly significant ways.<br> <br>

      Many of our designs are intended for use in instructional contexts including middle and high school classrooms.
