    <h1>What is ThoughtSwap?</h1>
    <p>
      It is a simple web application built around the idea that when we discuss 
      something we produce many thoughts. That, while we're concerned with how 
      those thoughts are received, we also care about properly understanding 
      the thoughts others share.
      <br><br> 
      ThoughtSwap addresses these concerns in two ways. First, by allowing 
      participants to be as anonymous as possible, anxieties associated with 
      contributing to the discussion like a rush to say something, or fear of 
      judgement, are minimized. Second by allowing thoughts to be distributed a 
      facilitator can direct participants to consider their received thought,
      (especially if it is different from their own) increasing the likelihood 
      that shared thoughts are truly heard and understood.
      <br><br> 
      Put in simpler terms, the situation is analogous to a facilitator posing a 
      question, participants throwing their thoughts into a hat on a folded 
      piece of paper, and each participant drawing from the hat after everyone 
      has contributed, then discussing the new thought.
      <br><br> 
      ThoughtSwap <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1718934">builds on 
      and continues research</a> on the effects of computer-supported 
      cooperative work. What began as a Java applet circa 2008 has since been 
      re-implemented as today's interface to reach a wider  audience.

    <h1>Who should use ThoughtSwap?</h1>
    <p>
      Anyone that finds themselves in a group of people, talking about any topic 
      should find ThoughtSwap helpful. Although the original design is based on 
      use in an educational setting, the concept is broad enough that it should 
      be easy to adapt to any discussion situation.

    <h1>How do I use ThoughtSwap?</h1>
    <p>
      Facilitators can easily get started by <a href="/register">registering for 
      an account</a> and creating a group on the page that follows. After a 
      group has been created, the facilitator can distribute the generated 
      sillynames to their participants in any way they see fit. Clicking the 
      group's name brings up the dashboard for that group.
      <br><br> 
      At this point, participants can log on with their sillynames and the 
      facilitator can choose to enter a prompt for everyone to respond to. Once 
      thoughts have been received, the facilitator can reorder them, enlarge 
      them for full-screen viewing, or delete them entirely. Participants can 
      also view or hide their previously submitted thoughts during this process.
      <br><br> 
      At any point, facilitators can distribute the thoughts received, change 
      the prompt of the session, or start a new session entirely. If thoughts 
      are distributed, participants see them on their screen and can assign 
      their received thought a color (which changes the thought on the 
      facilitator screen) in order to group similar thoughts.
      <br><br> 
      The suggested setup for this process a projector-connected computer for 
      the facilitator, and either a tablet or computer for each participant.
