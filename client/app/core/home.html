      <h1>Promote Conscientious Discourse </h1>
      <p>Conscientious Discourse is the effort to maintain a practice of  rigorous internal accountability while also listening and responding to other people.  With an interface designed for computers, tablets and smartphones, ThoughtSwap can change the dynamic of discussion in classrooms, civic spaces and other participatory arenas. </p>

          <h3>Prompt Questions</h3>
          <p>Get started quick with auto-generated participant logins. Easily

          <h3>Contained Anonymity</h3>
          <p>Contained Anonymity means that people can write anonymously but everyone knows that someone in the room has written each response.  Personal fear of exposure is reduced but not interpersonal pro-social responsibility.</p>

          <h3>Thought Redistribution</h3>
          <p> Swapping Thoughts means that people can be asked not only “What’s your opinion?” but also “What does someone else think?”  Each becomes responsible for representing and elaborating someone else’s thoughts whether they agree with them or not. </p>

          <h3>Prompts and Responding</h3>
          <p>  Writing broadens the scope of discussion.  A more diverse range of opinions in the room is presented for consideration than in traditional classroom discussion.  </p>

             them to the users in anyway. Your codename is not reported with your response, and
             previous thoughts are never saved.

      <p >ThoughtSwap is an infrastructure that can deepen participation in face-to-face discourse. The point of ThoughtSwap is the face-to-face discussion, not the
      technology.</p>
      <h3>A typical process:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><p>A facilitator posts a prompt.</p></li>
        <li><p>Participants write for a few minutes and submit their thoughts(anonymously).</p></li>
        <li><p>The facilitator convenes a face-to-face discussion for the whole group or for
        small groups that uses the anonymous submitted thoughts as a spring-board.</p>
          <ol type="a">
            <li><p>The facilitator may swap thoughts, so that each participant sees and becomes
            responsible for one other person’s thought.</p></li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li><p>The group reports back to the whole for next steps.</p></li>
